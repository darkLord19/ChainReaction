# ChainReaction

This repository contains backend API code for the game [Chain Reaction](https://brilliant.org/wiki/chain-reaction-game/) with online multiplayer mode.

endpoints:(both are GET endpoints)
1. /new

query parmas: players_count, dimension
on success:
```
{game_roomname: "gamblerripple"}
```

2. /games/:rommname/join

query params: username, color
on success:
```
{
    Success: "You have joined the game mothafucka"
    game_instance: {
        all_players: [{â€¦}]
        current_turn: 0
        dimension: 4
        players_count: 2
        room_name: "gamblerripple"
    }
    user: {
        color: "#FF1744"
        username: "test"
    }
```

3. /games/:roomname/colors
on success returns:
```
{
    colors: [...]
}
```

4. /games/:roomname/play

# How to Build
First you will need golang package installed for your respective OS. Refer golang homepage on HowTo.
```
git clone https://github.com/darkLord19/chainreaction
cd ChainReaction
go build
```
This will generate binary named chainreaction in the directory which you can run as normal unix/windows executable.

# Code overview
- api/ contains logic for endpoints
- simulate/ contains logic for chain reaction game, how to simulate gameboard etc
- datastore/ contains simple in memory mapping of current active games and all games
- game/ contains models required for game instance and other helpers
- models/ contains types used for game abstraction
- helpers/ contains helper functions for models
- utils/ contains utility function

# Future ideas
1. Build a decent front end to play the game
2. Plan a proper websocket messanging mechanism
3. Refractor code to better fit golang model
4. Add tests
